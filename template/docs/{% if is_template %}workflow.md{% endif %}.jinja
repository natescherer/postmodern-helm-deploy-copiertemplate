## Creating New Project

### Registry Type

#### Azure Container Registry

##### If Using Auth Mode 'Admin Credentials via Pipeline Variable'

    * Value: The password you copied above

## Applying to Existing Project

To apply this template to an existing project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your project is already using Git, and the all of the following are true:
    1. Project is cloned out to your local computer
    1. All changes are committed
    1. Default branch (usually `main` or `master`) is checked out
1. Create a new branch (`copier-template-apply`, for example) from your default branch
1. Make sure your shell is in the project root, then run the following in order to apply the template to your local project:

    ``` shell
{%- if using_github %}
    copier copy --trust --overwrite gh:{{ github_org }}{{ github_username }}/{{ repo_name }} .
{%- elif using_azdo %}
    copier copy --trust --overwrite git+https://dev.azure.com/{{ azdo_org }}/{{ azdo_project | replace(" ","%20") }}/_git/{{ repo_name }} .
{%- endif %}
    ```

1. If you are using GitHub, Make sure to choose `Set Repo Rules` in the first question
1. Set all other settings as appropriate for your project
1. Once the template is applied, review files that have been changed using git, and stage, discard, or modify as appropriate
1. Commit and push the changes, then merge them via a Pull Request
1. You are done, and your project will now operate the same as one that was generated from this template.
