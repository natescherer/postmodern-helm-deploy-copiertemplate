# Public vs Private Repos

In order to increase the usefulness of the Postmodern template ecosystem, full support for both Public and Private repositories are included.

## What is Public?

For the purposes of this template, a Public repo is an open-source project that is designed to be visible to the internet and to encourage contributions from others.

## What is Private?

For the purposes of this template, a Private repo is a closed-source project that is designed to be used within an organization.

## Differences

Private repos omit the following features that would not be relevant to them, with reasoning for each:

### Repository Management

* Contributor management and crediting via All Contributors
    * Unnecessary and likely unworkable inside an organizational context

### Support Files

* `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
    * It is assumed your organization will provide appropriate conduct code by other means
* `CONTRIBUTING.md`
    * Likely not needed for a private project, but you can always provide your own custom file which will be ignored by template updates
* `LICENSE`
    * If needed, you can always provide your own custom file which will be ignored by template updates
